#  Road Accident Data Analysis and KPI Validation

##  Project Overview

This is an end tp end data analyytics portfolio project focused on analyzing road accident data and validating key performance indicators (KPIs) across multiple tools.

The project demonstrates:

* Data validation using SQL
* Dashboard development in Excel, Power BI, and Tableau
* Cross platform KPI consistency verification


##  Objective

The main objective of this project is to:

* Analyze road accident trends 
* Build interactive dashboards in three different tools
* Validate all dashboard KPIs using MySQL 
* Ensure complete alignment between SQL outputs and visual reports



##  Dataset Information

* **Rows:** 307,974
* **Columns:** 21
* **Source Format:** CSV / Excel


### Key Variables:

* Accident_Index
* Accident_Severity
* Number_of_Casualties
* Road_Type
* Weather_Conditions
* Vehicle_Type
* Urban_or_Rural_Area
* Light_Conditions



##  Tools Used

* **MySQL Workbench** → KPI validation & aggregation
* **Excel** → Data cleaning & dashboard
* **Power BI** → Interactive dashboard & DAX measures
* **Tableau** → Visual analytics dashboard



##  KPIs Validated

The following metrics were validated using SQL:

* Total Casualties (2022)
* Total Accidents (2022)
* Casualties by Severity
* Severity Distribution (%)
* Vehicle Type Grouping
* Monthly Trend
* Road Type Breakdown
* Urban vs Rural Distribution
* Light Condition Analysis
* Top 10 Local Authorities

Each KPI shown in the dashboards has been cross-verified using SQL queries.

##  Validation Approach

All dashboard metrics were independently validated using MySQL queries.

* SQL results were compared with dashboard outputs
* Screenshots of SQL results are added in the validation report
* No inconsistencies were found between tools


##  Dashboard Previews

##  Key Skills Demonstrated

* SQL Aggregations & Window Functions
* KPI Engineering
* Data Validation Strategy
* Cross Tool Consistency Checking
* Business Oriented Dashboard Design
* Analytical Documentation
